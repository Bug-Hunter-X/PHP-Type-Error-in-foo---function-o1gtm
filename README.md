This repository contains a PHP function `foo()` that demonstrates a common type error. The function aims to add 1 to a number, but it lacks proper type checking.  The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of robust input validation in PHP to prevent unexpected behavior and runtime errors.
